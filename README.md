# ToledoWX (Weather)


Toledo, Ohio area weather information that is pulled from National Weather Serivce XML files and HTML pages.


## Perl

Perl scripts execute in cron at regular intervals. The scripts parse multiple NWS XML files and HTML pages, and the scripts download NWS images. The static HTML files are created on the local server.



### Required Modules

The following pure Perl modules were downloaded and included within the this app's lib directory.

* HTML::Template
* XML::TreePP
* XML::FeedPP
* YAML::Tiny



## jQuery Mobile

ToledoWX Perl scripts create jQuery Mobile HTML pages that allow users to read the information easily on all devices. jQuery Mobile enables the pages to display well on older versions of IE too.


## Error Log File

A "log" directory was created under app's home directory structure. 

In the log directory, an empty file was created called error.txt.

Sometimes, the NWS websites are unresponsive. After a timeouw, the script writes an error message to the log file, and the script exits.

This program went into use in June 2013. Sometimes, the XML files generated by the National Weather Service are formatted differently than expected within the Perl scripts. An error is logged.

May need to save a copy of the XML file that cannot be parsed to see what was changed to cause the error.


## Image Files

Under the Web server's document home directory, I created an "images" directory to store downloaded NWS images to be displayed in the HTML files created by the Perl scripts.
 
Again, because of the unresponsiveness of NWS websites at times, I felt it was better to store the images locally.
